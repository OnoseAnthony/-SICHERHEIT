- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OnoseAnthony
- ðŸ‘€ SICHERHEIT is a secure password generator script that uses hashing and displays the generated passwords in QRCode Images which can be scanned.
- ðŸŒ± Wrapped within a password management system using the Django web framework.

- # DISCLAIMER #
- Although this was intended to be a fully working application, i've decided to put a pause on it for design reasons.
- I'm not a front end developer so the front end design of the working version for this application uses a combination of front end code from multiple sources.
- You can always clone the project to make it better suited to your needs.
